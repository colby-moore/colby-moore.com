                        I'm a web developer that concentrated in software development, but also minored in Information Technology,
                        Information Science, and Cybersecurity. I am currently employeed at Mintz + Hoke, where I work on enterprise

                        When I'm not working you can catch me on the slopes in the winter, on the hiking trails in the spring/fall, and on the beach in the summer. 
                        I am working on two side projects at the moment, one having to do with E-Sports and the other as a way to dive deeper into the depths of Vue.js.
