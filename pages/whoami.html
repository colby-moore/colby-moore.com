                    <h3>A bit more info</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started out in college as an Information Technology major and ended up switching to a concentration in software development.
                        After working two different internships in the healthcare industry working in enterprise technology departments I decided on giving a 
                        web development course a try and quickly fell in love with the creativity that coding had to offer.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        When I'm not working you can catch me on the slopes in the winter, on the hiking trails in the spring/fall, and on the beach in the summer. 
                        I am working on two side projects at the moment, one having to do with E-Sports and the other as a way to dive deeper into the depths of Vue.js.
